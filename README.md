# Identity and Access Management on AWS

## Introduction

In any cloud environment, controlling access to resources is a critical security measure. Misconfigured permissions or unrestricted access can lead to accidental deletion, unauthorized modification, or even data breaches.
This project demonstrates how the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service can be used to enforce the principle of least privilege by defining who can access or modify specific AWS resources, particularly EC2 instances.
